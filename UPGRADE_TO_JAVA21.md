# Upgrade to Java 21 — Project2

Summary
- Upgraded project build to target Java 21 by adding/updating `pom.xml`.
- Installed JDK 21 at `C:\Users\Max\.jdk\jdk-21.0.8(1)` (local environment).
- Verified compilation under JDK 21 (successful `mvn clean compile`).

What changed
- `pom.xml`: `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` set to `21`; `maven-compiler-plugin` configured with `<release>21</release>`.

How to verify locally (PowerShell)
1. Use JDK 21 for this shell session:
```
$env:JAVA_HOME = 'C:\Users\Max\.jdk\jdk-21.0.8(1)'
$env:Path = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;${env:Path}"
```
2. Check Java version:
```
java -version
```
3. Build the project with Maven:
```
mvn -B -DskipTests=true clean compile
```

Notes & next steps
- The automated OpenRewrite recipe was attempted by the upgrade tooling but its wrapper-based validation step encountered argument parsing/plugin resolution issues in this environment. I did not introduce large code changes — only updated the `pom.xml` to target Java 21.
- If you want the OpenRewrite transformations (automatic code migrations for Java 21) I can try again using a local plugin invocation with careful quoting or add a small `rewrite` plugin section in `pom.xml` so it runs reliably.
- Recommend running your full test suite (if any) under JDK 21 and reviewing runtime behavior.

If you want me to continue: reply with **"Run OpenRewrite migrations"** to attempt an automated migration pass, or **"Finish"** to finalize and produce a short commit/PR summary.
